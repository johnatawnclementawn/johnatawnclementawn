<h2 align="center"> Hi, I'm Johnathan!</h2>
   

<h4>About me:</h4>

*I use the pronouns He/Him/His*

I am values driven person who cares deeply about making meaningful impacts for the communities that I work with. I use geospatial technology to do this.   

I'm a recent graduate of the [Master of Urban Spatial Analytics program](https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I studied how to help policy makers understand the policy implications of complex data analyses. I worked on problems such as building data pipelines to power a COVID-19 decision dashboard, building flood models to help policy makers prioritze funding of flood mitigation measures, and used deep learning algorithms to create land cover classification maps. 

Moving forward from this experience, I'm looking for opportunities to advance climate reslience using tools and techniques such as deep learning and computer vision, data pipeling, and environmental risk modeling.
